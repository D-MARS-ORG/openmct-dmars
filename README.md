# Open MCT Integration Tutorials

These tutorials will walk you through the simple process of integrating your telemetry systems with Open MCT.  In case you don't have any telemetry systems, we've included a reference implementation of a historical and realtime server.  We'll walk you through the process of integrating those services with Open MCT.


Before you run these tutorials, we recommend that you have a recent version of git installed, as well as a recent version of node.  Command line familiarity is a plus.

## How to use this tutorial.

As with any good cat, there are many ways to skin it.  Same applies to this tutorial-- there are many ways to follow it.  The easy way would be to follow the instructions.  However, you are free to jump around from step to step-- this repository has been tagged at each step so that you can checkout the code at any point.  To skip to a specific section, `git checkout part-a-step-5`


## Ready, set, go!


npm install openmct

You can read the code and learn by inspection....
or you can checkout a blank slate and walk through the tutorials step by step.  If you get stuck at any step, you can skip to the next step with `git checkout step-n`

if you're not familiar with git... simply having it installed (and following the instructions exactly) should be all you need.  Oh, and node.



# Installing Open MCT:
