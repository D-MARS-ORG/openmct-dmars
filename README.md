Second Priority:
Telemetry Providers
Also: supporting new-style telemetry in old telemetry api.


Third Priority:
Fixing object API. (persistence spaces, etc.)

Fourth Priority:
What do we use to simplify AJAX for tutorial.

# Bugs

Non-expandle items have hover effects where the expand disclosure arrow would be, but don't handle click events.

Need to figure out how to handle composition policy which is based on type
and also based on "applies to".  

Can attempt to save objects in immutable folders-- should check for mutability before containment.

NEed generic telemetry type??

Document Telemetry Metadata. (what are values, what properties matter?)

<!-- change type.cssclass to type.cssClass -->
