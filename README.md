VERY IMPORTANT
* [ ] Supporting new-style telemetry in old telemetry api. (support fixed position)
* [ ] Enable time conductor and set default to last fifteen minutes
  * [ ] Time Conductor API: Needs to function even if the UI is not enabled.
    * [ ] Need realtime/etc to work without it.
* [ ] enumeration formatting / format services in general.
* [ ] NEed generic telemetry type??
* [ ] standardize openmct.plugins: either they all are a function that returns a plugin or they are all a plugin.
* [ ] Document Telemetry Metadata. (what are values, what properties matter?)

SLIGHTLY LESS IMPORTANT
* [ ] Limit evaluator registration

UNKNOWN:
* [ ] Fixing object API. (persistence spaces, etc.)
* [ ] Update documentation.
* [ ] Complete tutorial documentation.
* [ ] Provide python server implementation.
* [ ] Ensure new-style points can be added to fixed position.

REPORT LATER:
* Non-expandle items have hover effects where the expand disclosure arrow would be, but don't handle click events.
* Need to figure out how to handle composition policy which is based on type
and also based on "applies to".  (maybe also applies to telemetry checking.)
* Can attempt to save objects in immutable folders-- should check for mutability before containment.
