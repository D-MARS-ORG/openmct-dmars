# Bugs

Non-expandle items have hover effects where the expand disclosure arrow would be, but don't handle click events.

Need to figure out how to handle composition policy which is based on type
and also based on "applies to".  

Can attempt to save objects in immutable folders-- should check for mutability before containment.
